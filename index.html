        <h2 id="about" class="title">About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a 16 year old developer from the United States.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I'm currently working as Technical Support representative and going to a trade school for Computer Information Technology (or "Management Information Systems"). 
            I'm also working on a few projects, which you can find in the <a href="#projects">Projects</a> section.
            I'm very interested in programming, and most likely going for a software engineering or computer science major in college. 
            One of my favorite computer concepts is internet of things. IoT is super interesting to learn about and I hope to work with it in the future.

        <h2 class="title">About This Website</h2>
        <p>
            Yeah, I'm not a <b>web developer.</b> This website doesn't even have any JavaScript. It's a static website with average HTML and sub-par CSS. That's fine. 
            A website doesn't have to be over-the-top fancy, it just has to get a point across. I mean, now you surely <i>must</i> know who I am, right?

            My current only project is <a href="https://connect.conchdev.com/" target="_blank">Connect</a>, a social media platform by Twisea. The main point about Connect, though, 
            is that its primary client is a Discord bot. Connect allows users from any Discord server to interact with others from different servers.

        <p>
            I have very many ways of contact. Unfortunately, I'm not always active on them. Below, you can find a list of ways to contact me and the likeliness that 
            I'll respond. Just don't send me a random friend request. I'll probably decline it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">Direct Contact</h3>
        <p><b><a href="mailto:conch@twisea.net" target="_blank">Email</a>: </b>Likely within 24-48 hours</p>
        <p><b><a href="https://discord.com/users/579041484796461076" target="_blank">Discord</a> @WhoIsConch: </b>Extremely likely to respond fast.</p>
        <p><b><a href="https://twitter.com/UnsoughtConch" target="_blank">"X"</a>: </b>I'm not very active on Twitter, but I'll quickly respond to any DMs.</p>
