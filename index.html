        <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a 15 year old developer from the United States.</p>
        <p>
            I'm the founder and head developer at <a href="https://github.com/Twisea" target="_blank">Twisea Social Networks</a>, a small team of developers currently
            working on a social networking platform called Connect. I'm very interested in technology and how it can be used to solve problems and make people's lives easier.
            I currently know Python and am learning JavaScript, but I'm planning to learn more.
        </p>
        <h3>Languages I know</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Languages I'm learning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Languages I'm planning to learn</h3>

            <li>Julia</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>
            Yeah, I'm not a <b>web developer.</b> This website doesn't even have any JavaScript. It's a static website with average HTML and sub-par CSS. That's fine. 
            A website doesn't have to be over-the-top fancy, it just has to get a point across. I mean, now you surely <i>must</i> know who I am. Right?
        </p>

    <div class="container projects">
        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>
            My current only project is <a href="https://connect.conchdev.com" target="_blank">Connect</a>, a social media platform by Twisea. The main point about Connect, though, 
            is that its primary client is a Discord bot. Connect allows users from any Discord server to interact with others from different servers.

        <p>
            I have very many ways of contact. Unfortunately, I'm not always active on them. Below, you can find a list of ways to contact me and the likeliness that 
            I'll respond.

        <h3>Unsolicited Friend Request Notice</h3>
        <p>
            If you make a friend request out of the blue, I'm most likely going to ignore it due to all of the scams surrounding these platforms.
            If you want to contact me via Discord, Revolt, or Matrix, please try contacting me before friend requesting.
